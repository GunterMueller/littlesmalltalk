This contains the implementations of A Little Smalltalk from the
former "A Little Smalltalk" project. I'm not actively working on
any of these now, but keep the sources here to help keep this
historical system from being lost.

lst3, lst4, and lst5 should all work pretty well. lst1 and lst2
are based on really old sources, but I occasionally try to build
them and fix bugs and warnings.


My thanks go to Timothy Budd for creating this, Danny Reinhold for
obtaining permissions to release and update these, and Dmitry Geurkov
for sending me patches to fix several issues with lst1.
